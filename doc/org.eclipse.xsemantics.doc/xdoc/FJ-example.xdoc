chapter:FJ[Featherweight Java]

Featherweight Java is a lightweight functional version of Java, 
which focuses on a few basic features. It is not intended to be used as
a programming language, but as a formal framework for studying properties 
of Java (A. Igarashi, B. Pierce, and P.Wadler. e[Featherweight Java: a 
minimal core calculus for Java and GJ]. ACM TOPLAS, 23(3):396-450, 2001.). 
In this section we will see how to write the type system of FJ using Xsemantics.
(As future work we will also define the operational semantics of FJ in Xsemantics.)

section:FJInANutshell[FJ in a nutshell]

FJ focuses on the following features: 
mutually recursive class definitions, inheritance, object creation, 
method invocation, method recursion through this, subtyping and field access. 
In particular, a FJ program is a list of class definitions and a single 
main expression.
Here's an example of an FJ program:

code[Java][
class A extends Object { }
class B extends Object { }

class Pair extends Object {
    Object fst;
    Object snd;

    Pair setfst(Object newfst) {
        return new Pair(newfst, this.snd);
    }

    Pair setsnd(Object newscd) {
        return new Pair(this.fst, newscd);
    }
}

new Pair(new A(), new B()).setfst(new A()).fst
]

Since in FJ the class constructor has a fixed shape, we consider a 
simplified version of the language by assuming constructors as implicit; 
in particular when invoking code[new] we should pass an argument for each field 
in the class, including inherited fields, in the same order of the hierarchy. 
Thus, if we have the following classes

code[Java][
class A { int i; boolean b; }
class B extends A { String s; }
]

we must create an instance of code[B2] as follows: 
code[Java][new B(10, true, "foo")].

section:FJInXtext[FJ implemented in Xtext]

We had already implemented FJ in Xtext (that implementation can be found at 
link[http://fj-eclipse.sourceforge.net][http://fj-eclipse.sourceforge.net]).  
In that implementation, the type system was implemented directly in Java.  
With Xsemantics we ship another implementation of FJ where the type system is 
written using Xsemantics instead of manually written Java code.

code[Xtext][
grammar org.eclipse.xsemantics.example.fj.FJ with org.eclipse.xtext.common.Terminals

generate fj "http://xsemantics.sf.net/example/fj/FJ"

Program :
	(classes += Class)*
	(main = Expression)? ;

Type: BasicType | ClassType;

BasicType : basic=('int' | 'boolean' | 'String');

ClassType : classref=\[Class\];

Class:
	'class' name=ID ('extends' superclass=\[Class\])? '{'
		(members += Member)*
	'}' ;

Member: Field | Method;

Field: type=Type name=ID ';' ;

Method:
	type=Type name=ID '(' (params+=Parameter (',' params+=Parameter)*)? ')' '{'
		body=MethodBody
	'}' ;

Parameter: type=Type name=ID ;

TypedElement: Member | Parameter;

MethodBody: 'return' expression=Expression ';' ;

Expression:
	TerminalExpression 
	=>(
		{Selection.receiver=current} '.' 
		message=\[Member\]
		('(' (args+=Expression (',' args+=Expression)*)? ')')?
	)* ;

TerminalExpression returns Expression:
   This |
   ParamRef |
   New |
   =>Cast |
   Constant |
   Paren ;

This: variable='this';
ParamRef: parameter=\[Parameter\];
New: 'new' type=ClassType '(' (args+=Expression (',' args+=Expression)*)? ')';
Cast: '(' type=ClassType ')' expression=TerminalExpression;
Paren returns Expression: '(' Expression ')'; 

Constant: IntConstant | BoolConstant | StringConstant;

StringConstant: constant=STRING;

IntConstant: constant=INT;

BoolConstant: constant = ('true' | 'false');
]

section:FJTypeSystem[FJ Type System]

We start by defining the name (we skip imports), the auxiliary descriptions
(which will be used for auxiliary functions, ref:Auxiliary[]) and the judgments
(ref:Judgments[]); we also use an injected field (ref:Fields[])
of type codeRef[org.eclipse.xsemantics.example.fj.util.FjTypeUtils]
which contains some auxiliary functions that we will use in the rules.

code[Xsemantics][
system org.eclipse.xsemantics.example.fj.typing.FjTypeSystem

inject FjTypeUtils fjTypeUtils

auxiliary {
	superclasses(Class cl) : List<Class>
	fields(Class cl) : List<Field>
	methods(Class cl) : List<Method>
	overrides(Method current, Method previous)
		error current.name + " does not override the superclass method"
		source current
	isValue(Expression e) : Boolean
	/* replaces in a copy of the body's expression:
	 * 'this' with thisReplacement and
	 * param references with args */ 
	replaceThisAndParams(MethodBody body,
			Expression thisReplacement, 
			List<Parameter> params, List<Expression> args
		) : MethodBody
}

judgments {
	type |- Expression expression : output Type
		error "cannot type " + stringRep(expression)
		source expression
	classtype |~ Expression expression : output ClassType
		error stringRep(expression) + " has not a class type"
		source expression
	subtype |- Type left <: Type right
		error stringRep(left) + " is not a subtype of " + stringRep(right)
	assignable |- Expression expression |> Type target
		error stringRep(expression) + " is not assignable for " + stringRep(target)
		source expression
	equalstype |- Type left ~~ Type right
		error stringRep(left) + " is not the same type as " + stringRep(right)
	subtypesequence |- 
		Expression owner ~> 
			List<Expression> expressions << List<? extends TypedElement> elements
		error "invalid arguments for expected parameters"
		source owner
}
]

In the following we explain the rules of these judgments.
Note that auxiliary functions corresponding to the above defined auxiliary
descriptions must be defined before implementing the rules.  However, in this
document, we will concentrate on the implementations of the rules, and show
the auxiliary functions when they are used by the rules. 

section2:FJTyping[Typing FJ Expressions]

Let's start with simple expressions

code[Xsemantics][
axiom TParamRef 
	G |- ParamRef paramref : paramref.parameter.type

// you can manually create the BasicType with EMF FjFactory...
axiom TStringConstant
	G |- StringConstant s : { 
			val result = FjFactory::eINSTANCE.createBasicType();
			result.basic = 'String'
			result
		}

// ...or use an utility class...
axiom TIntConstant
	G |- IntConstant i : fjTypeUtils.createIntType

// ...or closures
axiom TBoolConstant
	G |- BoolConstant b : 
	\[ 
	    BasicType t |
		t.basic='boolean'
		t
	\].apply(FjFactory::eINSTANCE.createBasicType())
]

The type of a parameter reference is simply the type of the referred
parameter (since code[Parameter] is an element with an explicit type).

Just to show the syntax of rules in Xsemantics which rely on Xbase,
we present above three different ways of creating the basic types (initialized
with the corresponding string).  This is just a demonstration: probably, the
best way is relying on static utility methods implemented for your DSL
(as we did with codeRef[org.eclipse.xsemantics.example.fj.util.FjTypeUtils]).  Alternatively, as we did with the
Expressions example (see ref:Expressions[]), we could have a different
class for each basic type.

code[Xsemantics][
rule TNew
	G |- New newExp : newExp.type
from {
	var fields = fields(newExp.type.classref)
	// we want the superclasses' fields first
	G |- newExp ~> newExp.args << fields
}
]

The type of a code[New] expression is the classtype mentioned in the expression
itself (e.g., the type of the expression code[Java][new C()] is code[C]).
However, we must also check that the expression is well-typed, i.e., that
all the arguments passed to the new expression are subtypes of the corresponding
fields of the classtype (see ref:FJInANutshell[] for the syntax of constructors
in our implementation of FJ).  In order to collect all the fields of the
given class (including the inherited ones), we use 
the auxiliary function code[fields] (which, in turns, rely on
the auxiliary function code[superclasses]):

code[Xsemantics][
auxiliary superclasses(Class cl) {
	getAll(cl,
		FjPackage::eINSTANCE.class_Superclass,
		FjPackage::eINSTANCE.class_Superclass,
		typeof(Class)
	)
}

auxiliary fields(Class clazz) {
	var Iterable<Field> fields = new ArrayList<Field>
	
	// inherited fields must come first
	for (superclass : superclasses(clazz)) {
		fields = 
			(EcoreUtil2::typeSelect(superclass.members, typeof(Field)) 
				+ fields)
	}
	fields = fields + EcoreUtil2::typeSelect(clazz.members, typeof(Field))
	Lists::newArrayList(fields)
}
]

Note that, in order to get all the superclasses of a class
we use code[getAll], ref:GetAll[] (Remember that using code[getAll]
avoids infinite loops in cases of cycles in the AST).

Now that we have all the fields, we can check that
the types of the arguments are subtypes of the types of these fields
(we use the judgment code[subtypesequence], described in ref:FJSubTyping[]).

code[Xsemantics][
rule TCast
	G |- Cast cast : cast.type
from {
	G |- cast.expression : var Type expType
	
	G |- cast.type <: expType
	or
	G |- expType <: cast.type
}
]

A cast expression, statically, is well-typed if the type of the object and the type we cast to are related,
and has the type of the type we cast to.

code[Xsemantics][
rule TSelection
	G |- Selection selection : selection.message.type
from {
	G |- selection.receiver : var ClassType receiverType
	// check message if it's a method call
	val message = selection.message
	switch (message) {
		Method: { 
			G |- selection ~> selection.args << message.params
		}
	}
}
]

The type of the selection is the type of the selected code[Message]
(which refers to a code[Member]).
However, we must check that the received of the message is well-typed,
and in particular that it has a class type (since message selection,
i.e., field access or method invocation, is allowed only on class instances).
We perform this check by using as the output argument a code[ClassType]
(thus, that rule invocation would fail if the receiver had a basic type).

Furthermore, if the message refers to a code[Method], we must
check that the arguments types are subtypes of the method parameters
(we use the judgment code[subtypesequence], described in ref:FJSubTyping[]).

code[Xsemantics][
axiom TThis
	G |- This _this : env(G, 'this', ClassType)
]

For the type of code[Java][this] we use the predefined function code[env] 
(see ref:Environment[]) which returns the value contained in the environment (first parameter of code[env])
which corresponds to the passed key (code['this'] in this case), provided the mapped
value is a code[ClassType].  
The function code[env] fails (and thus makes the rule fail) if no mapping for the specified
key is found in the environment.  Who puts the mapping for code['this'] in the environment?
We'll see that later (ref:FJScoping[] and ref:FJValidation[]).
However, we assume that if this rule fails it is because we are trying to type code[Java][this]
from outside a method body (e.g., in the program's main expression). 

section2:FJScoping[FJ Scoping]

We use the generated system from the rules defined in Xsemantics in the
scope provider, in particular for the scope of the members in
a code[Selection] expression: we need the type of the receiver to
know which members are visible in that selection expression:

code[Java][
public class FJScopeProvider extends AbstractDeclarativeScopeProvider {

	@Inject FjTypeSystem typeSystem;

	@Inject FjTypeUtils fjTypeUtils;

	public IScope scope_Member(Selection sel, EReference ref) {
		return Scopes
				.scopeFor(getMembers(getExpressionClass(sel.getReceiver())));
	}

	protected Class getExpressionClass(Expression receiver) {
		ClassType classType = typeSystem.classtype(
				environmentForExpression(receiver), receiver).getValue();
		return (classType != null ? classType.getClassref() : null);
	}

	private RuleEnvironment environmentForExpression(Expression expression) {
		Class containingClass = EcoreUtil2.getContainerOfType(expression,
				Class.class);
		if (containingClass != null) {
			ClassType thisType = fjTypeUtils.createClassType(containingClass);
			return new RuleEnvironment(typeSystem.environmentEntry("this",
					thisType));
		}
		return null;
	}

	public List<Member> getMembers(Class cl) {
		List<Member> allMembers = new LinkedList<Member>();
		try {
			allMembers.addAll(typeSystem.fields(cl));
			allMembers.addAll(typeSystem.methods(cl));
		} catch (RuleFailedException e) {
			// the list will be empty
		}
		return allMembers;
	}
}
]

In order to get the type of the receiver expression we use the generated
system (refer to ref:GeneratedSystem[]).  However, we need to provide
a binding for code[Java][this] in the environment (see ref:FJTyping[]),
thus we build a codeRef[org.eclipse.xsemantics.runtime.RuleEnvironment] (see
also ref:Environment[]) where we associate the string code["this"] to
the class which contains the current selection expression.

We also use the generated methods corresponding to the
auxiliary functions code[fields] and code[methods].

Note that we do not use the code[type] judgment, but the judgment
code[classtype] (refer to ref:FJTypeSystem[]) which already returns
a code[ClassType] as the output
parameter.  This judgment has only one simple rule which relies on
the code[type] judgment, but using as the output argument a code[ClassType]:

code[Xsemantics][
rule TExpressionClassType
	G |~ Expression expression : ClassType classType
from {
	G |- expression : classType
}
]

Once we have the class type of the receiver, we simply use an
auxiliary function to collect all the members of that class.

section2:FJSubTyping[FJ Subtyping]

We have a judgment code[subtype] which given a code[left] and code[right]
arguments succeeds if the former is a subtype of the latter.  Here are the
rules for this judgment:

code[Xsemantics][
rule GeneralSubtyping
	G |- Type left <: Type right
		error "types " + stringRep(left) + " and " + stringRep(right) +
			" are not comparable"
from {
	// if we get here we're trying to mix
	// a BasicType with a ClassType, thus, we fail
	fail
}

rule BasicSubtyping
	derives G |- BasicType left <: BasicType right
from {
	left.basic.equals(right.basic)
}

rule ClassSubtyping
	derives G |- ClassType left <: ClassType right
from {
	left.classref == right.classref
	or
	right.classref.name == "Object"
	or
	superclasses(left.classref).contains(right.classref)
}
]

The general case always fails, since we cannot mix basic and class types.
Then for basic types we do not have actual subtyping, thus the two
basic types must be the same.  For class types we have three possible
cases:

ol[
item[the two classes are the same (class subtyping is reflexive)]
item[the right class is code[Object] (every class is implicitly subclass of code[Object])]
item[The right class is a parent of the left class (class subtyping is transitive);
in order to check this last case, we get all the superclasses (using
the code[superclasses] auxiliary function shown before), and use the
standard Java codeRef[java.util.List] code[contains] method]
]

Remember that, since code[ClassType] has a reference to an actual
code[Class] object, it is safe to use object identities.

We also have a code[assignable] judgment which tells whether an
code[Expression] is assignable to a type, by getting the type of
of the expression and then checking the subtyping:

code[Xsemantics][
rule ExpressionAssignableToType
	G |- Expression expression |> Type target
from {
	var Type expressionType
	G |- expression : expressionType
	G |- expressionType <: target
}
]

Since in the typing rules for expressions (see ref:FJTyping[]) we
have to check whether arguments are subtypes of parameters (in the
code[New] and code[Selection] rules) we isolate a specific judgment
code[subtypesequence], that we recall here

code[Xsemantics][
judgments {
	// ...
	subtypesequence |- 
		Expression owner ~> 
			List<Expression> expressions << List<? extends TypedElement> elements
		error "invalid arguments for expected parameters"
		source owner
}
]

whose (single rule) is implemented as follows:

code[Xsemantics][
rule SubtypeSequence derives
	G |- Expression owner ~> 
		List<Expression> expressions << List<TypedElement> typedElements
from {
	expressions.size == typedElements.size
	or
	fail
		error "expected " + typedElements.size + " arguments, but got " +
			expressions.size
		source owner 
	
	val typedElementsIterator = typedElements.iterator
	for (exp : expressions) {
		G |- exp |> typedElementsIterator.next.type
	}
}
]

First of all, the sizes of the two collections must be the same;
if this first check fails we explicitly fail (see ref:ExplicitFailure[])
with an informative error; in order to make the error really informative
and, most of all, to make the error marker generation effective
(see ref:ErrorGeneration[]), we need the "owner" of this check, i.e.,
the expression context where this check has to be carried out, in order
to specify that expression as the source of the error (ref:ErrorSpecification[]).
Compare this with the way this judgment is used in the typing of
code[New] and code[Selection] (ref:FJTyping[]).  If this first check
succeeds, we check that every expression is a subtype of the corresponding
type; in order to do this we rely on code[assignable] statement,
described before.

We also have the judgment code[equalstype] for type equality,
similar to code[subtype], which will be used in check rules for
validation (ref:FJValidation[]):

code[Xsemantics][
rule GeneralEquals
	G |- Type left ~~ Type right
		error "types " + stringRep(left) + " and " + stringRep(right) +
			" are not comparable"
from {
	// if we get here we're trying to mix
	// a BasicType with a ClassType, thus, we fail
	fail
}

rule BasicEquals
	derives G |- BasicType left ~~ BasicType right
from {
	left.basic.equals(right.basic)
}

rule ClassEquals
	derives G |- ClassType left ~~ ClassType right
from {
	left.classref == right.classref
}
] 

section:FJValidation[FJ Validation]

We define some checkrules (ref:CheckRules[]) for validating an FJ program.

code[Xsemantics][
checkrule CheckMethodBody for
	Method method
from {
	val typeForThis = FjTypeUtils::createClassType(
		EcoreUtil2::getContainerOfType(method, typeof(Class))
	)
	'this' <- typeForThis |- method.body.expression |> method.type
}
]

This rule checks that the return expression of a method body is
a subtype of the declared method's type.  It relies on the
judgment code[assignable] seen in ref:FJSubTyping[].  However,
since this will involve being able to type possible occurrences
of code[this] we must also pass an explicit envrionment (ref:Environment[])
with a mapping for code['this'] (mapped to the class type of the class
containing the method).  This is similar to what we do for FJ scoping
(ref:FJScoping[]).

code[Xsemantics][
checkrule CheckField for
	Field field
from {
	val clazz = field.eContainer as Class
	
	if (clazz.superclass != null) {
		var inheritedFields = fields(clazz.superclass)
		// make sure no duplicate fields in the hierarchy
		inheritedFields.forEach \[
			inheritedField |
			if (field.name == inheritedField.name) {
				fail
					error "field already defined in superclass " +
						stringRep(inheritedField.eContainer)
			}
		\]
	}
}
]

For a code[Field] we must check that a field with the same name
is not defined in the superclasses (for fields with the same name in the
same class this check is already done by Xtext predefined
codeRef[org.eclipse.xtext.validation.NamesAreUniqueValidator]).
Again, we rely on the auxiliary function code[fields].

For methods we cannot execute the same check, since subclasses
are allowed to redefine methods, provided they keep the same signature
(in FJ covariance of return type is not allowed); thus we defined an
auxiliary function, code[overrides], defined
as follows:

code[Xsemantics][
auxiliary overrides(Method current, Method previous) {
	current.name != previous.name
	or
	{
		empty |- current.type ~~ previous.type
		or
		fail error 
		"cannot change return type of inherited method: " +
			stringRep(previous.type)
		source current
		feature FjPackage::eINSTANCE.typedElement_Type
		
		current.params.size == previous.params.size
		val previousParamsIt = previous.params.iterator
		for (param : current.params) {
			empty |- param.type ~~ previousParamsIt.next.type
		}
	}
}
]

Which basically says that a method correctly overrides another
one if their names are different (no actual overriding to check)
or if they have exactly the same signature (relying on judgment
code[equalstype]).

Thus, the checkrule for code[Method] is

code[Xsemantics][
checkrule CheckMethodOverride for
	Method method
from {
	val clazz = method.eContainer as Class
	
	if (clazz.superclass != null) {
		var inheritedMethods = methods(clazz.superclass)
		val methods = EcoreUtil2::typeSelect(clazz.members, typeof(Method))
		// check override predicate
		inheritedMethods.forEach \[
			inheritedMethod |
			methods.forEach \[
				overrides(it, inheritedMethod)
			\]
		\]
	}
}
]

Note the use of Xbase closure (please refer to ref:ExpressionsInPremises[]
for the way Xsemantics interprets boolean expressions inside premises and
closures).

For a code[Class] we need to check that its superclass hierarchy is
not cyclic:

code[Xsemantics][
checkrule CheckClassHierachyNotCyclic for
	Class cl
from {
	if (cl.superclass != null) {
		!superclasses(cl).contains(cl)
		or
		fail
			error "Cyclic hierarchy for " + cl.name
			source cl
	}
}
]

which basically checks that the current class is not in the
superclasses of itself.

Finally, we check that we can give a type to the main expression
of an FJ program, in the empty environment:

code[Xsemantics][
checkrule CheckMain for
	Program program
from {
	program.main == null // nothing to check
	or
	empty |- program.main : var Type mainType
}
]

section:FJReduction[FJ Operational Semantics]

todo[The operational semantics, i.e., reduction rules, are implemented, but
documentation for this part has to be written yet.]
